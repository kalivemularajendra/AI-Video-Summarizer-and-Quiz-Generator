    **Objective:** Analyze the provided video content and generate a structured Summary.

    **Based *only* on the provided video, please provide the following:**

    1.  **Main Topics Covered:**
        * Identify and list the primary subjects or themes discussed throughout the video. Use a concise bulleted list.

    2.  **Detailed Summary:**
        * Write a comprehensive summary that accurately captures the main arguments, information flow, key concepts, and conclusions presented in the video.
        * Structure the summary logically (e.g., following the video's progression or grouping related ideas).
        * Ensure the summary is detailed enough to give someone who hasn't seen the video a thorough understanding of its content.

    3.  **Key Takeaways / Highlights:**
        * Extract the most significant points, essential facts, core messages, findings, or actionable advice presented.
        * List these as clear, concise bullet points, focusing on the essential highlights.

    4.  **Relevant Online Resources:**
        * Identify and provide links to reputable online resources that directly expand on, support, or are referenced by the topics discussed in the video.
        * **Priority:** First, include any specific URLs or resource names explicitly mentioned in the video's content or accompanying description (if this information is available).
        * **Secondary:** If few or no resources are mentioned, find [Specify Number, e.g., 3-5] relevant, high-quality external links (e.g., official websites, reputable articles, academic papers, tools related to the topic).
        * **Annotation:** Briefly describe the content and relevance of each link provided.

    **Instructions:**
    * Use clear headings for each of the four sections requested above (e.g., "Main Topics Covered", "Detailed Summary", "Key Takeaways", "Relevant Online Resources").
    * Derive all summaries and key points *directly* from the provided video information. Do not add external information to the summary or key points.
    * Ensure the resource links are functional and relevant as of the current date.

    **Requirements:**

    * **Source:** Strictly use information *only* from the `Knowledge_base`. Ignore external data/references mentioned within it.
    * **Question Phrasing:** Frame questions naturally as standard quiz questions. **Do not use phrases** like "According to the knowledge base..." or similar source attributions.
    * **Content:** Focus questions on specific details found in the `Knowledge_base`: key facts, concepts, definitions, processes, steps, arguments, or specific terminology presented.
    * **Format:**
        * Numbered list for questions.
        * Each question: 1 correct answer, 3 plausible distractors (labeled A, B, C, D).
        * Clarity: Questions must be clear and directly answerable from the source.
    * **Output:** Indicate the correct answer by placing a tick emoji (âœ…) **directly next to the correct option**. No separate answer key needed.
